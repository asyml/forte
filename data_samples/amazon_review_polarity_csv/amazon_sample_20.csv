1,One year on and overheated and failed,"Fine until a year later the mouse pointer stopping and starting on the screen. I noticed the hub was hot, unplugged and let it cool and start again. The problem then started more frequently and the unit became very hot. Had to toss it in the end. Won't buy Belkin again."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible tasting","I read so many reviews on this product.Trying to get a feel for the taste reviewed by others. I tried strawberries and creme and chocolate. First, let me say, I read someone review about how they had one of these, then went to the store, and threw up in a isle. I had a very similar experience. Very nasty tasting. I simply do not understand how anyone can say these taste good. I would seriously make sure you are reading actual reviews. Check peoples shopping history for more than a few items. I believe they are fake and lying. This crap was nasty. I would never, ever, ever, ever, recommend this product. They taste horrible."
2,"Deserves Its ""Classic Album"" Status","Elton was so prolific at this point that he could release 5 studio albums in 3 years, a live album, a movie sound track and still have enough for a two record set. This one is a keeper, with songs that could have fit in on any of his earlier albums. (I'm thinking ""Danny Bailey"" and ""Roy Rogers"" on Tumbleweed Connection, and ""Harmony"" for Elton John, to name a few"") There are, of course, the obligatory monster singles ""Good Bye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting,"" ""Benny And The Jets,"" and the single that never was ""Candle In The Wind."" What sets this album apart is the opening ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,"" an Elton staple in his 70's concerts. All in all, this is definitely his best."
1,Formac - BEWARE!,"What can I say, never in my life have I been so utterly dissapointed with a purcahse. These monitors aren't cheap by any standard, as such you'd expect a performance in line with the price, and maybe, just maybe that some of the claims that the manufacturers make are actually based in truth rather that out and out lies.Response time 10-25ms? I've seen first generation TFT's of a cost of 100 outperform this kit. It's claims about zero ghosting are a complete lie, It suffers form some of the worst ghosting artefacts I've encountered on a TFT. Which considering it's claims to be ideally suite to video editing and the like make this TFT useless for the job.After sales support from Formac? This just doesn't exist, full stop. They seemingly will only deal with the dealers direct. Not you, the little guy.My advice is steer well clear of this product & the manufacturer as they both fail to deliver to the standards they claim."
1,Disappointing - too much violence and too little history,"I love history movies, particular about the ancient world, so I wanted to see this movie - alas, it was first of all a war movie that had little dept and instead far, far more gory violence than I care for. While there is a historic background to the story, it really only provides that: a background. The story is shallow and predictable and seems to serve only to justify as much violence as possible. This movie would not appeal to someone who is actually interested in history as the time period serves only as a backdrop - the very same story could have been framed in any other time without needing to go any more indept in the details of the particular historic period. Not recommended for anyone - there is little if anything to learn, not about history, not about emotion, intellect, or spirituality. Instead, once more the viewer is inundated with too many images of violence that are already over abundant in our world today."
1,Has No Range,"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
2,Great Music,"I generally hate it when singers attempt to sing '60's and '70's Motown that were not a part of the Organization during that era. However, MM is an exception. He offers his own style without taking the funk and soul out of the music like many other pop artists, namely Mike Bolton and Linda Ronstadt, are notorious of doing.He delivers very powerful heart thumping vocals that are impossible for any singer to replicate. His opener, ""Heard it Thru the Grapevine,"" set the stage for some great rhythms with terrific instruments and background singers throughout the track. ""Ain't no Mountain"" is another great rendition by him. Usually, no matter how great the record, there are at least one or two bad songs but such doesn't appear to be the case here.Michael McDonald has released one of the top CD's of the year."
1,Dont order from worldofbookusa!,It has been a month since I ordered this book from worldofbookusa and I still have not received it. I'm sure the book is great but the supplier is not.
1,Ruined By Rumor Mongering,"I was thrilled to find a new biography of Hepburn because she's such an intriguing personna. In this book, however, Parrish puts forth many rumors and hearsay as fact without bothering to back them up. This ruined what could have been an interesting bio for anyone curious about the Katharine Hepburn outside of the stage lots. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,FABULOUS book!,This is one of the best books ever written! I recommend this book to anyone with an active imagination.
1,Worst Logitech mouse ever. Save your $ for a nicer model,Save your money and buy a better Logitech mouse than this. They should be embarrassed at the LOW quality of this mouse. The batteries last less than a month and the range is insulting. It's very choppy even when the USB reciever is plugged in right next to the mouse (using a Mac keyboard). I look forward to the day when my newer Logitech mouse arrives and I can throw this one away.
1,Useful but Advanced Tech. for Java Developers is better.,"Advanced Tech. for Java Developers contains in one chapter what this book drags out. But ATFJD also gives you good info on Beans, Servlets, JNI ... . If some one gives you a copy of Java RMI you will get something out of it, but buy the other one. I bought both (sigh)."
1,We didn't enjoy this game.,"My wife and I purchased this game after reading all the positive reviews. We play a lot of different types of board games (Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, etc.) and were looking for a fun, light, card game to play. This game felt more like a 2-player version of solitaire. Also, why buy this game? Basically, read the rules at Rio Grande Games (The link is posted in my comments, Amazon won't let me post it here).Then, take a STANDARD deck of cards and:1. Put each Ace in a row on the table, these are the 'Expeditions'.2. The Kings, Queens, and Jacks are your 'Investment Cards'.3. Play the game as normal.In the Lost Cities card game you have 5 suits instead of 4. That's the only difference between buying the game and my version of using a standard deck."
2,Great summer read,"Tony Parsons has a great way of setting up his characters so you really feel like you know them. I found the book so funny I laughed out loud at times, while at other times, I almost felt a tear. a very ""real"" story."
1,kindergarten lace,"I was not impressed with this book. The opening paragraph states that Mary had collected lace patterns all of her life. Surely she had collected somethings that were prettier than the plain, boring and very 'solid'(Meaning, very little actual lace in the patterns) doilies exemplified in this book. Of the entire book there were only two doilies with which I would consider bothering."
1,Kung Fu Vampires,Got this movie as part of a box set. Best thing about the movie is that it is less than 90 minutes long.
1,Saddened,I have been a huge fan of The Whispers for about 35 years or more. The songs that I have been searching for were listed on the CD description however when it arrived they are not included on this CD. I am very disappointed because I already have a compilation cd which includes three of the best cuts on this cd.
2,Another Classic Roald Dahl,"Dahl has done it again in creating a fascinating world of fantasy that almost seems true. I liked the opening of the book best, when he's describing how to tell if someone's a witch. The descriptions are vivid and fun. I especially liked it when he tells you that maybe your teacher could even be a witch. Not my favorite Roald Dahl (BOY), but a great read, and, as always, much better than the movie."
2,Great Brazilian Pianist = Great Brazilian Jazz Album !!!!,"Gilson has been (and still is) a great pianist with a wonderful and christaline technique belonging to the impressive elite among Brazilian Jazz Pianists.Here he pays homage to several of the best Brazilian composers ( Edu Lobo, Ivan Lins & Vitor Martins, Roberto Menescal & Ronaldo Boscoli, Joao Donato & Joao Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim & Vinicius de Moraes, Caetano Veloso, Lucio Alves & Haroldo Barbosa, Luiz Eca & Fernanda Quindere, Armando Cavalcante & Klecius Calda, Carlos Lyra, Abel Ferreira, Tito Madi, Chico Feitosa, Joao Bosco & Aldir Blanc ).Some of these cuts are energetic and explosive and some are wonderful ballads; all of them with a very impressive jazz approach. Check it out; it's absolutely worth trying."
1,Book is an INFOMERCIAL for Scoblete's crap school,"This book is pretty expensive for what should be really be a series of advertisements, magazine articles and ""trip reports"". I haven't read much by Scoblete before, but if this is any indication it's not good. There are a few redeeming passages about characters in the crap world but other than that I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it if I hadn't read it already.First, his editor should be fired for allowing through the 12th grade composition level writing.Second, every second sentence is about Scoblete and how he eventually got involved in a craps shooting school.Third, he admits this was the second of three books his publisher required him to write under contract. This explains a lot. Like how it seems to be a mish mash of random notes taken on gambling trips rolled into a ""book"" to be sold to YOU. If you are at the poker table and you can't tell who the sucker is - it's you."
