    def __init__(self, onto_file_path: Optional[str] = None):
        r"""An implementation of the data store object that mainly uses
        primitive types. This class will be used as the internal data
        representation behind data pack. The usage of primitive types provides
        a speed-up to the previous class-based solution.

        A DataStore object uses primitive types and simple python data
        structures to store a collection of Forte entries for certain types of
        unstructured data.
        Currently, DataStore supports storing data structures with linear span
        (e.g. Annotation), and relational data structures (e.g Link and Group).
        Future extension of the class may support data structures with 2-d range
         (e.g. bounding boxes).

        Internally, we store every entry in a variable ``__elements``, which is
        a nested list: a list of ``entry lists``.

        Every inner list, the ``entry list``, is a list storing entries for a
        single particular type, such as entries for
        :class:`~ft.onto.base_ontology.Sentence`. Different types are stored in
        different lists: [ <Document List>, <Sentence List>, ...]. We will
        discuss the sorting order later.

        The outer list, stores a list of ``entry lists``, and each ``entry list``
        is indexed by the type of its element. Specifically, each type is
        associated with a unique ``type_id``, which is generated by the system.
        The mapping between ``type_name`` and ``type_id`` is defined by a dictionary
        ``self.__type_index_dict``.

        Entry information is stored as ``entry data`` in each ``entry list``.
        Each element in the ``entry list`` (an entry data) corresponds to one
        entry instance.

        Each ``entry data`` in the ``entry list`` is represented by a list of
        attributes.
        For example, an annotation type entry has the following format:
        [<begin>, <end>, <tid>, <type_name>, <attr_1>, <attr_2>, ...,
        <attr_n>].
        A group type entry has the following format:
        [<member_type>, <[members_tid_list]>, <tid>, <type_name>, <attr_1>,
            <attr_2>, ..., <attr_n>, index_id].
        A link type entry has the following format:
        [<parent_tid>, <child_tid>, <tid>, <type_name>, <attr_1>, <attr_2>,
        ..., <attr_n>, index_id].

        The first four fields are compulsory for every ``entry data``. The third
        and fourth fields are always ``tid`` and ``type_name``, but the first and
        second fields can change across different types of entries.
        For example, first four fields of Annotation-Like (e.g. subclasses of
        Annotation or AudioAnnotation) entries are always in the order of
        ``begin``, ``end``, ``tid`` and ``type_name``. ``begin`` and ``end``, which are
        compulsory for annotations entries, represent the begin and end
        character indices of entries in the payload.

        The last field is always ``index_id`` for entries that are not
        Annotation-like. It is an extra field to record the location of the
        entry in the list. When the user add a new entry to the data store,
        the ``index_id`` will be created and appended to the end of the original
        ``entry data`` list.

        Here, ``type_name`` is the fully qualifie name of this type represented
        by ``entry list``. It must be a valid ontology defined as a class.
        ``tid`` is a unique id of every entry, which is internally generated by
        uuid.uuid4().
        Each ``type_name`` corresponds to a pre-defined ordered list of
        attributes, the exact order is determined by the system through the
        ontology specifications.
        E.g. an annotation-type ``entry data`` with type
        :class:`~ft.onto.base_ontology.Document` has the following structure:
        [<begin>, <end>, <tid>, <type_name>, <document_class>, <sentiment>,
        <classifications>].
        Here, <document_class>, <sentiment>, <classifications> are the 3
        attributes of this type. This allows the ``entry list`` behaves like a
        table, we can find the value of an attribute through the correct
        ``index_id`` id (e.g. index of the outer list) and `attr_id`
        (e.g. index of the inner list).

        Note that, if the type of ``entry list`` is Annotation-Like (e.g.
        subclasses of Annotation or AudioAnnotation), these entries will be
        sorted by the first two attributes (``begin``, ``end``). However, the
        order of a list with types that are not Annotation-like, is currently
        based on the insertion order.

        ``onto_file_path`` is an optional argument, which allows one to pass in
        a user defined ontology file. This will enable the DataStore to
        understand and store ``entry_type`` defined in the provided file.

        Args:
            onto_file_path (str, optional): the path to the ontology file.

        super().__init__()
        self.onto_file_path = onto_file_path

        """
        The ``_type_attributes`` is a private dictionary that provides
        ``type_name``, their parent entry, and the order of corresponding attributes.
        The keys are fully qualified names of every type; The value is a dictionary with
        two keys. Key ``attribute`` provides an inner dictionary with all valid attributes
        for this type and the indices of attributes among these lists. Key ``parent_entry``
        is a string representing the direct parent of this type.

        This structure is supposed to be built dynamically. When a user adds new entries,
        data_store will check unknown types and add them to ``_type_attributes``.
