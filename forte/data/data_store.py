    def __init__(self, onto_file_path: Optional[str] = None):
        r"""An implementation of the data store object that mainly uses
        primitive types. This class will be used as the internal data
        representation behind data pack. The usage of primitive types provides
        a speed-up to the previous class-based solution.

        A DataStore object uses primitive types and simple python data
        structures to store a collection of Forte entries for certain types of
        unstructured data.
        Currently, DataStore supports storing data structures with linear span
        (e.g. Annotation), and relational data structures (e.g Link and Group).
        Future extension of the class may support data structures with 2-d range
         (e.g. bounding boxes).

        Internally, we store every entry in a variable `__elements`, which is
        a nested list: a list of `entry lists`.

        Every inner list, the `entry list`, is a list storing entries for a
        single particular type, such as entries for
        `ft.onto.base_ontology.Sentence`. Different types are stored in
        different lists: [ <Document List>, <Sentence List>, ...]. We will
        discuss the sorting order later.

        The outer list, stores a list of `entry lists`, and each `entry_list`
        is indexed by the type of its element. Specifically, each type is
        associated with a unique `type_id`, which is generated by the system.

        Entry information is stored as `entry data` in each `entry list`.
        Each element in the `entry list` (an entry data) corresponds to one
        entry instance.

        Each `entry data` in the `entry list` is represented by a list of
        attributes,
        For example, an annotation type entry has the following format:
        [<begin>, <end>, <tid>, <entry_type>, <attr_1>, <attr_2>, ...,
        <attr_n>].
        A group type entry has the following format:
        [<member_type>, <[members_tid_list]>, <tid>, <entry_type>, <attr_1>,
            <attr_2>, ..., <attr_n>].
        A link type entry has the following format:
        [<parent_tid>, <child_tid>, <tid>, <entry_type>, <attr_1>, <attr_2>,
        ..., <attr_n>].

        The first four fields are compulsory for every `entry data`. The third
        and fourth fields are always `tid` and `entry_type`, but the first and
        second fields can change across different types of entries.
        For example, first four fields of annotations entries are always in
        the order of `begin`, `end`, `tid` and `entry_type`. `begin` and `end`,
        which are compulsory for annotations entries, represent the begin and
        end character indices of entries in the payload.

        Here, `entry_type` is the fully qualified name of every entry. `tid`
        is a unique id of every entry, which is internally generated by
        uuid.uuid4().
        Each `entry_type` corresponds to a pre-defined ordered list of
        attributes, the exact order is determined by the system through the
        ontology specifications.
        E.g. an annotation-type `entry data` with type
        `ft.onto.base_ontology.Document` has the following structure:
        [<begin>, <end>, <tid>, <entry_type>, <document_class>, <sentiment>,
        <classifications>].
        Here, <document_class>, <sentiment>, <classifications> are the 3
        attributes of this type. This allows the `entry list` behaves like a
        table, we can find the value of an attribute through the correct entry
        id (e.g. index of the outer list) and attribute
        id (e.g. index of the inner list).

        Note that, if the type of `entry list` is Annotation-Like (e.g.
        subclasses of Annotation or AudioAnnotation), these entries will be
        sorted by the first two attributes (`begin`, `end`). However, the
        order of a list with types that are not Annotation-like, is currently
        based on the insertion order.

        `onto_file_path` is an optional argument, which allows one to pass in
        a user defined ontology file. This will enable the DataStore to
        understand and store `entry_type` defined in the provided file.

        Args:
            onto_file_path (str, optional): the path to the ontology file.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.onto_file_path = onto_file_path

        """
        The `_type_attributes` is a private dictionary that provides
        `entry_type` and the order of corresponding attributes.
        The outer keys are fully qualified names of valid ontology types as
        strings, including all types that inherit the `Entry` class.
        The inner keys are all the valid attributes for this type.
        The values are the indices of attributes among sortedlists.

        This structure is supposed to be obtained by processing the dictionary
        generated by another function get_type_attributes(). This function will
        be called in class `EntryTypeGenerator`.
