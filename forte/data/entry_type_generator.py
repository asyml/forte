        While initializing the new data structure, we need a list of all the valid annotations,
        links and groups. For example, for annotations, we want to have a list of types as strings,
        ["Token", "Subword", "Sentence", ...], including all the types defined in ft.onto and
        ftx.onto. Please notice that users could also create their own types of data which inherit
        "forte.data.ontology.core.Entry".
        For each type, we want to obtain all the attributes. For example, for sentence we want to
        get a list of ["speaker", "part_id", "sentiment", "classification", "classifications"]. We
        want to get the attributes for each type of entry as a dictionary. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            type_attributes = {
                "Token": ["pos", "ud_xpos", "lemma", "chunk", "ner", "sense",

        The `dataclass` module<https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html> can add
        generated special methods to user-defined classes. There is an in-built function
        called `__dataclass_fields__` that is called on the class object, and it returns
        all the fields the class contains.

        Note: This function is only applicable to classes decorated as Python
        `dataclass` since it relies on the `__dataclass_fields__` to find out the attributes.

        For example, for Sentence we want to get a list of
        ["speaker", "part_id", "sentiment", "classification", "classifications"].
