To create a new top level entry, the following steps are required to
make sure it available across the ontology system:
    1. Create a new top level class that inherits from `Entry` or `MultiEntry`
    2. Add the new class to `SinglePackEntries` or `MultiPackEntries`
    3. Insert a new conditional branch in `EntryConverter.save_entry_object()`
    4. Decide two main attributes which will qualify as your `attribute_data`
        parameters. These parameters will be passes in your branch of
        `EntryConverter.save_entry_object()`. If there are no such parameters,
        you can pass None
    5. add `getter` and `setter` functions to update `attribute_data` parameters
        if you have any
    6. If additional attributes are required, make the class a `dataclass` and set
        `dataclass` attributes.

    """
    A box class with a reference point which is the box center and a box
    configuration.
    Given a box with shape parameters (height, width), we want to locate its
    four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). We need
    to know the locaton of the center of the box.
    Generally, we can either use box standalone or as a bounding box in object
    detection tasks. In the later case, we need to consider its association with
    a grid as the task is performed on each grid cell.
    There are several use cases for a box:
        1. When we use a box standalone, we need the box center to be set.
        The offset between the box center and the grid cell center is not used.
        2. When we represent a ground truth box, the box center and shape are
        given. If we want to compute loss, its grid cell center is required to
        compute the offset between the box center and the
        grid cell center.
        3. When we predict a box, we will have the predicted box shape (height,
        width) and the offset between the box center and the grid cell center,
        then we can compute the box center.
    .. code-block:: python
        pack = DataPack("box examples")
        # create a box
        simple_box = Box(pack, 640, 480, 320, 240)
        # create a bounding box at with its center at (320, 240)
        gt_bbx = Box(pack, 640, 480, 320, 240)
        # create a predicted bounding box without known its center
        # and compute its center from the offset and the grid center
        predicted_bbx = Box(pack, 640, 480)
        predicted_bbx.set_offset(305, 225)
        b.set_grid_cell_center(Grid(64, 48, 640, 480), 1, 1)
        print(b.cy, b.cx) # it prints (320, 240)
    For example, in the object detection task, dataset label contains a ground
    truth box (box shape and box center).
    The inference pipeline is that given a grid cell, we make a prediction of a
    bounding box (box shape and box offset from the grid cell center).
        1. If we want to locate the predicted box, we compute the box center
        based on the second use case.
        2. If we want to compute the loss, we need values for the center, shape
        and offset for both boxes. And we need to compute the offset between
        the box center and the grid cell center based on the third use case.
    A more detailed explanation can be found in the following blog:
    https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo2-walkthrough-with-examples-e40452ca265f
    Based on the use cases, there are two important class conditions:
        1. Whether the box center is set.
        2. Whether it's associated with a grid. (It might or might not
        depending on the box use cases)
    Note: all indices are zero-based and counted from top left corner of
    image. But the unit could be a pixel or a grid cell.
    Args:
        pack: the container that this ``Box`` will be added to.
        height: the height of the box, the unit is one pixel.
        width: the width of the box, the unit is one pixel.
        cy: the row index of the box center in the image array,
            the unit is one pixel. If not set, it defaults to None.
        cx: the column index of the box center in the image array,
            the unit is one pixel. If not set, it defaults to None.
        image_payload_idx: the index of the image payload. If it's not set,
            it defaults to 0 which meaning it will load the first image payload.
