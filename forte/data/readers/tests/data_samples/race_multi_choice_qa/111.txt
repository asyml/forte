Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit  ?\nIf you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant. The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk   said it was like a snake. The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear(  ) as he touched the animal's tusk. The fourth, who took hold of the elephant's tail, insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The last, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan.\nEach man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \"simple fact\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours.\nTo see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \"simple fact\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second. Put lukewarm water  in the third. Now put your left hand in the hot water. Put your right hand in the lukewarm water. Your right hand will tell you the water is cold. Your left hand will tell you it is hot.", "id": "middle111.txt"}
