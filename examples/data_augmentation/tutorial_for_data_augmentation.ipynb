    "Lots of data augmentation methods can be considered as replacement-based approaches. That means, given a piece of input text, we will replace it with a new piece of augmented text. The back translation achieves this by translating the input into another language, then translating it back, and replacing the input with back-translated text.\n",

To use these algorithms, set the value of *`'data_aug_op'`* in the configuration to full qualified name of the replacement op, and set the configuration of the replacement op in the *`'kwargs'`* under the field *`'data_aug_op_config'`*.
