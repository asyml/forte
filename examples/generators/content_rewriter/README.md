## A Content Re-writer Example

This example implements a content rewriter. Given a table and a sentence, this
will rewrite the sentence based on the table.

Run `pipeline.py` to execute the rewriter. The other files are:
 - `reader.py`: reads the data.
 - `reweriter.py`: conducts the actual rewriting.
