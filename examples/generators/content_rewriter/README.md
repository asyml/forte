## A Content Re-writer Example

This example implements a content rewriter. Given a table and a sentence, this
will rewrite the sentence based on the table.

- The `pipeline.py`
  - Running this will execute the rewriter from a pack. 

- The `prepare_pipeline.py`
  - Running this will prepare some sample data. 
  
- `reader.py`: reads the data.
- `reweriter.py`: conducts the actual rewriting.
