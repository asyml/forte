i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine ill admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge 	pos	pos0
if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed i thought that the characters were well developed costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well yes ashton kutcher can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermorei thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it in conclusion good characters great plot poorly written edited ending still go see it 	pos	pos10
i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time its kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it im not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect im still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian features it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate him but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs  darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clichés predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought id have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education  not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers the gist moviegoers wanting an inside look at what its like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but had i paid i wouldve felt i had gotten my moneys worth 	pos	pos11
i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater we have all seen this plot line before top gun gi jane an officer and a gentleman but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer played by ashton kutcher i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives however the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall do his own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie we all had a good time despite a couple of tough moments in the movieand i think you will too 	pos	pos12
i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day today it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70s show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the u s coast guard 	pos	pos13
i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances & films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility to save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowing i havent seen such angry seas since the perfect storm co star clancy brown hbos carnivale great to see him again played the captain of the coast guards kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end 	pos	pos14
as others that have commented around the web im a 130 pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the skeptic i am i went expecting the over the top cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accurate i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday ive realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isnt the case the movie is truly more character story driven than action the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with kutchers is revealed further into than movie than costners is of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old wounds as girlie as it sounds costner and as much as i try not to like him kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie as critics have stated youve seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasnt been remade a million times i can recall only one f word being spoken and cant really recall any other language the movie is 2+ hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the end youll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the $4 i paid i hope you enjoy the movie 	pos	pos15
i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made the postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since robin hood have i seen this costner full of depth and complex emotion kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in butterfly effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films ive seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie its not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible thats what i think good film making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work bravo 	pos	pos16
brilliant and moving performances by tom courtenay and peter finch 	pos	pos17
the dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films the film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of norman tom courtenay although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer albert finney that he assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious in the end the dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema 7 7 out of 10 	pos	pos18
this is one of my three all time favorite movies my only quibble is that the director peter yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i forgive him albert finney and tom courtenay are absolutely marvelous brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done scene after scene just blows me away and then theres the heartbreaking climax 	pos	pos19
my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian at first i didnt want to watch it but i loved the movie it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime they portrayed the uscg very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more not only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to see the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could 	pos	pos1
the many other comments about the film say it all just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 8 6 wed 100% recommend it then for todays audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience did the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding of course finney and courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non techy use of camera and sound was a great influence how delightful many said to see a really great film thats british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood & guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even uttered by some who were younger 	pos	pos20
my yardstick for measuring a movies watch ability is if i get squirmy if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesnt know when to quit however i was most impressed by ashton kutchers performance i have never liked him never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature well punk in this film he does a great job he is well on his way to having leading man status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2 3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback particularly on the parts of the film we didnt like *****possible spoiler the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin costner comes home to see his wife sela ward packing her stuff up and moving out he says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you dont know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesnt make sense if she knows the layout so well costner is right he *should* be the one to leave 	pos	pos2
how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i cant count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk but see the movie despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact youll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out why  costner and kutcher played their characters very well i have never been a fan of kutchers and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian but he surfaced in good fashion costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costners ability i dont think mrs robinson had anything to do with his success the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too much from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just dont expect a smooth ride 7 of 10 but almost a 6 	pos	pos3
this movie was sadly under promoted but proved to be truly exceptional entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film i couldnt image ashton kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character this movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it this films is truly exceptional 	pos	pos4
i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect unfortunately even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didnt have enough story line support though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath there was very little none to that effect in the movie overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating not sure ill ever go deep sea fishing again i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented definitely a movie that couldve been seen on dvd 	pos	pos5
i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre release last night and though i wasnt expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes im not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés 	pos	pos6
our family and the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed the guardian kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake after seeing this movie you cant help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u s coast guard the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue i feel the movie could have been made without the hollywood bar scene when you see the movie you might agree since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior  very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing thank you u s coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers so others may live id highly recommend this movie to everyone 	pos	pos7
im a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessels captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in kodiak it looked more like a nasa command center we dont have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller & a radio watchstander otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search & rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days 	pos	pos8
ive seen this story before but my kids havent boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and dont generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments costner well i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons 	pos	pos9
once again mr costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters most of us have ghosts in the closet and costners character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time i did not care the character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident ashton kutcher the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet his only obstacle appears to be winning over costner finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker costner tells us all about kutchers ghosts we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing no magic here it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in 	neg	neg0
years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence im like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there  the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100% unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like shes on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie shes no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release 	neg	neg10
julie andrews satirically prods her own goody two shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy drama but if she approaches her role with aplomb shes alone in doing so blake edwards film about a woman who is both music hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesnt know what tone to aim for and rock hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second fiddle musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 and elephantine productions like star and this film really tarnished andrews reputation leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until the tamarind seed came along ive always thought julie andrews wouldve made a great villain or shady lady her strong voice could really command attention and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive husband director edwards seems to realize this but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario screenwriter william peter blatty isnt a good partner for edwards and neither man has his heart in this material beattys script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence a striptease *1 2 from **** 	neg	neg11
blake edwards tried very hard to change julie andrews image in this film he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was i think they were both still a bit irked that julie had not been chosen to film her broadway success of camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough unfortunately they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson who we all know now was gay kissing julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie it seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that julie was a femme fatale but that rock was straight sadly they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out the other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making it is almost three separate movies there is the drama of julie as the german spy trying to get military secrets from rock there is an air war movie with lots of footage of wwi vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that blake edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not in this case it was not the only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely dame julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell like soprano of course if you love her you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her you can always tell yourself afterward that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through star 	neg	neg12
an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake lets see where do we begin she is a traitor during a world war she redeems that by falling in love her friends who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens are expendable and must die and she winds up as a heroine ok the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence cant even be described and we wont even mention rocks romantic scenes with a female by the way when they visit a museum look at his gaze i reran it on video and its priceless is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie i dont know and you wont either 	neg	neg13
some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not a college professor david norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesnt have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for dr norwell this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around adams inabilities and seizures why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner 	neg	neg14
few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiable now that ive got my distress out of my system i am more able to analyse the movie * from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true * next we get regular glimpses into radhas dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie im still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the surrealism was lost * the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the two * the names chosen for the women radha and sita are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasnt meant for indian audiences in the first place the shock through name selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd * the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject * the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbish in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please 	neg	neg15
for years ive been a big fan of parks work and old boy is one of my all times favorite with lots of expectation i rented this movie only to find the worst movie ive watched in awhile its not a proper horror movie theres no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that i didnt know whether to laugh or cry i introduced my younger brother to chan wook park and what a disappointment he got from this for me an idol has fallen if you loved movies like old boy the mr & lady vengeance or even his short films on three extremes dont waste your time the films not worth it 	neg	neg16
might end up being the biggest disappointment that i will see in 2009 i seem to be the rare person who disliked parks oldboy but i think that his lady vengeance and sympathy for mr vengeance are among the best films ive seen in the 2000s decade therefore i really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews instead i found the film clichéd and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre and while i can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this i felt park did this at very inopportune times others have compared contrasted this to let the right one in and i have to say that let the right one in was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre sadly parks take was a tired one 	neg	neg17
bloody birthday opens to a shot of meadowvale general hospital there three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse a caption informs us that it is now meadowvale california june 1 1980 two teenage lovers duke benson ben marley and annie smith erica hope are getting down to business in an open grave they hear noises and duke investigates both duke and annie are murdered sheriff jim brody bert kramer is baffled and only has the handle of a childs skipping rope that annie was holding as a clue unfortunately before sheriff brody can solve the case his youngest daughter debbie elizabeth hoy and two of her friends curtis taylor billy jayne as billy jacoby and steven seton andy freeman murder him just as they are finishing sheriff brody off another young boy from their class named timmy russel k c martel turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw soon after the incident timmy plays with steven and curtis in a junkyard curtis locks timmy into an old locker timmy manages to escape and tell his sister joyce lori lethin but she doesnt believe him at first the three children carry on their murder spree their strict teacher miss davis susan strasberg a lovemaking couple john avery and sylvia wright in a van and debbies older sister beverly julie brown are among their victims joyce begins to have her suspicions about debbie curtis and steven which makes her and timmy a target for the evil trio will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers co written and directed by ed hunt i have an intense dislike for this film i think its absolutely awful and doesnt have a single enjoyable aspect to its 83 minute running time the script by hunt and barry pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children dont have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse if that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthdays before starting their killing spree i guess it just suddenly kicks in right to its credit it is reasonably well paced but i still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through the film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as ive mentioned next to no motive is given its very silly at times too check out the scene where debbie stops steven by throwing a bowl of water over him the sheriffs death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident arent going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent doctor or pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds there isnt a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative there is some out of place looking nudity as debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister beverly strips there is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing the general incompetence continues throughout the film the whole production is bland and instantly forgettable the acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially curtis in his geeky over sized glasses i just hate this film really simple as that i cant think of a single good thing to say about it definitely one to avoid 	neg	neg18
this movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named curtis killing people the other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses the actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to revenge of the nerds another thing that i hate so much about this movie is that curtis takes his sweet time shooting people i kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice he sounded like he was fourteen and not ten another thing i hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there that didnt make any sense and neither did the music the music didnt fit any of the scenes this movie is slow boring and a waste of time watch a different movie on your birthday 	neg	neg19
this is a pale imitation of officer and a gentleman there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed its too long and the climax is anti climactic i love the uscg its men and women are fearless and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie doesnt do much for recruiting i fear the script is formulaic but confusing kutchers character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasnt his fault costners is raging against the dying of the light but why his conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my moneys worth 	neg	neg1
a mean spirited repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children susan strasberg is totally wasted in a 5 minute cameo even though she receives star billing if your a julie brown fan youll want to check it out since shes naked in a couple of shots all othersavoid 	neg	neg20
it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different we get the usual ripped off scenes from oaag i want you dor the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes hell quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the instructor is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves the main problem with this oaag wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one dimensional you never care for either in the least and when kutchers character finally turns around just like gere did in oaag you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie whats more baffling is the great reviews i see here the general publics opinions never cease to amaze me 	neg	neg2
wow another kevin costner hero movie postman tin cup waterworld bodyguard wyatt earp robin hood even that baseball movie seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention the characters are almost always the same the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie were all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there and this time the story story  is just a collage of different movies you dont need a spoiler youve seen this movie several times though it had different titles youll know what will happen way before it happens this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with backdraft but both are easily better movies watch backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor russell plays the hero 	neg	neg3
alas another costner movie that was an hour too long credible performances but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there first we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story will the script center on randall and his wife randall and fischer how about fischer and thomas in the end no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties the singer explains randall randall explains fischer on and on finally long after you dont care anymore you will learn something about the script meetings three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision the end result all three were used one after another after another if you can hang in past the 100th yawn youll be able to pick them out despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the coast guard this one should have washed out the very first day 	neg	neg4
i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this it seems to be divided into two parts action sequences and personal dramas ashore it follows ashton kutsher through survival swimmer school guided by master chief kevin costner then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place the last resulting in death i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen puddle pirates the experienced old timer costner who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the coast guard the older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that hes still nineteen the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors all in pursuit of a loftier goal the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past the problem is that weve seen it all before if its kevin costner here its clint eastwood or john wayne or lou gosset jr or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from the perfect storm and dead calm none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmers school and what could happen afterward and even thats a little weak because we dont get much in the way of instruction its mostly personal conflict romance and tension about washing out its a shame because the u s coast guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles in world war ii the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks but again we dont learn much about that we dont really learn much about anything the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else a disappointment 	neg	neg5
a tough sell british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether the actors effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of king lear during an air raid yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation based on the waning years of actor donald wolfit whose dresser was ronald harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery chewing thespians unfortunately albert finney at this point in his career not at all elderly seems too robust and quick thinking to play the actor finney and oscar nominated director peter yates cannot modulate sirs moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene hes stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next hes curiously falling apart with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss and his future yet servant tom courtenay prods and badgers and goads finney to carry on rather than rest courtenay who played this part on stage and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film these two thankfully do not peck at each others heads and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love hate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the films first act but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity theres nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was *1 2 from **** 	neg	neg6
blake edwards legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes a combination of the eagle has landed star oh what a lovely war and edwards pink panther films darling lili never engages the viewer the aerial sequences the musical numbers the romance the comedy and the espionage are all ho hum at what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn this disaster wavers in tone never decides what it wants to be and apparently thinks its a spoof but its pathetically and grindingly square old fashioned in the worst sense audiences understandably stayed away in droves its awful james garner would have been a vast improvement over hudson who is just cardboard and he doesnt connect with andrews and vice versa and both andrews and hudson dont seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness blake edwards sob isnt much more than ok but its the only good that ever came out of darling lili the expensive and professional look of much of darling lili only make what its all lavished on even more difficult to bear to quote paramount chief robert evans 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture 	neg	neg7
im not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies it was mediocre at best hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role it just didnt work for me julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy sorry i know that is classic stereotyping on my part but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking i always thought of her as more matronly but then surely thats a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role she was quite beguiling in appearance here but i still didnt buy her as a spy i couldnt keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out and having conversations with those in my room which i usually never do im always shushing everybody so that tells you how little it held my attention dont waste your time 	neg	neg8
david bryces comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970 it cost 22 million dollars that is simply irresponsible darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque the result is a hybrid of gigi zeppelin half a sixpence some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style daisies and boaters so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge and mata hari dramatics the production is colossal lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance julie looking befuddled hudson already dead the mistimed comedy and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up star released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hour but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s and made andrews look like poppins again which i believe was not edwards intention paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this and with another $20 million festering in catch 22 and $12 million in on a clear day and $25 million in paint your wagon they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double thank god paramount had their simple $1million yes one million dollar film love story and that $4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years for just $5m incredible 	neg	neg9
