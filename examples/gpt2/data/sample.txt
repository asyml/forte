When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
