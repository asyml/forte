    "## Background\n",
    "This notebook tutorial is derived from [a classification example](https://github.com/asyml/forte/tree/master/examples/classification).\n",
    "Given a table-like csv file with some columns of input text data and one column of the label, we set up a text classification pipeline below. This tutorial is also an excellent example of wrapping external library classes/methods into `PipelineComponent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline\n",
    "* [Pipeline setup](https://github.com/asyml/forte/blob/master/examples/classification/bank_customer_intent.py#L123)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pipeline has one reader `ClassificationDatasetReader` and two processor\n",
    "`NLTKSentenceSegmenter` and `ZeroShotClassifier`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reader\n",
    "* [ClassificationDatasetReader](https://github.com/asyml/forte/blob/7dc6e6c7d62d9a4126bdfc5ca02d15be3ffd61ca/forte/data/readers/classification_reader.py#L26)\n",
    " * `set_up()`: It checks whether the configuration is correct. For example, `skip_k_starting_lines` should be larger than 0. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. It also converts different table data at the label column to a digit.\n",
    " * `_collect()`: read rows from csv file and returns an iterator that yields line id and line data.\n",
    " * `_cache_key_function()`: use the line id as the cache key. \n",
    " * `_parse_pack()`: parse data from the iterator returned by `_collect` and load it in the ``DataPack``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processor\n",
    "In this example, we want to classify data sentence by sentence so we wrapped `nltk.PunktSentenceTokenizer` in [NLTKSentenceSegmenter](https://github.com/asyml/forte-wrappers/blob/80cfe19926c0596edd13985581e8ca01a7be86ad/src/nltk/fortex/nltk/nltk_processors.py#L247) to segment sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `_process()`: split ``DataPack`` text into sentence spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then need a model to do classification. We wrap `transformers.pipeline` in \n",
    "[Huggingface ZeroShotClassifier](https://github.com/asyml/forte-wrappers/blob/main/src/huggingface/fortex/huggingface/zero_shot_classifier.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_process()`: running classifier over ``DataPack`` data and writing the prediction results back to the ``DataPack``.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ZeroShotClassifier` and `NLTKSentenceSegmenter` both inherit from `PackProcessor` as it processes one `DataPack` at a time. Suppose if we process one `MultiPack` at a time, we must inherit `MultiPackProcessor` instead. "
