    "# Zero-Shot Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification, also known as text tagging or text categorization, is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content. These algorithms are at the heart of various software systems that process text data at scale. For example, the emails received go through a text classification task of filtering spam vs. non-spam emails. Social media platforms use text classification to determine whether comments should be flagged as inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Introduce you to text classification with `Zero-Shot Learning`\n",
    " * learn to write custom python functions to evaluate our model\n",
    " * Get your hands dirty with coding experiments to improve our model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will go through the Forte pipeline and learn how well it integrates with other third-party libraries like `HuggingFace` and `NLTK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at this tutorial, we first need to appreciate the broad scope of this topic."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In general, most machine learning-based modeling involves these three important steps :\n",
    "\n",
    " * Data gathering and processing\n",
    " * Modeling\n",
    " * Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the gathered data is very low to train a deep neural network(`DNN`) model in some cases. In such cases, we generally use a pre-trained `DNN` model trained on some large dataset, and then we 'fine-tune' the model on our dataset. This kind of modeling is called transfer learning. And Zero-Shot text classification is an extreme example of transfer learning, where the model tries to classify without any fine-tuning. This kind of model uses the similarity between the input text and label name to decide the class based on the highest similarity score. So this method does not need any labeled data. Well-defined Label names are sufficient to achieve good performance."

    "\n",
    "We will use the Pandas library to read the CSV file and visualize the input data. There are three columns in the input CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Labels with value 1 are considered Negative, and value 2 are considered Positive.\n",
    " * Title as a short title to the review.\n",
    " * body is the complete description of the review.\n",
    " \n",
    "We can use either of them as our text input to build our classifier."
