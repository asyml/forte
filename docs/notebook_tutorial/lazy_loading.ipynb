    "Sometimes it is preferable to load data only when it is required. For example, when creating a pipeline that handles a large amount of image data, a naive way would be to load the data at the beginning (i.e. through a reader), and pass all the data along the pipeline.\n",

    "Yet this approach could be inefficient since the actual images are passing along the pipeline, potentially through a network.

    "2. To use the lazy loading mechanism in `Payload`, it is preferable to register a function for a dedicated type. This will help you organize the loading methods of different types of data. Under the hood. Forte simply assign the loading method into the corresponding `Payload` class. This means method overriding will work as expected: if a different `load` function is assigned to a child class, then the `load` function registered to the child class will be used."
