**Bring good software engineering to your ML solutions, starting from Data!**

**Forte** is a data-centric framework designed to engineer complex ML workflows. Forte allows practitioners to build ML components in a composable and modular way. Behind the scene, it introduces [DataPack](https://asyml-forte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook_tutorial/handling_structued_data.html), a standardized data structure for unstructured data, distilling
good software engineering practices such as reusability, extensibility, and flexibility into
ML solutions.

DataPacks are standard data packages in an ML workflow, that can represent the source data (e.g. text, audio, images) and additional markups (e.g. entity mentions, bounding boxes). It is powered by a customizable data schema named "Ontology", allowing domain experts to inject their knowledge into ML engineering processes easily.

## Quick Start Guide
Writing NLP pipelines with Forte is easy. The following example creates a simple pipeline that analyzes the sentences, tokens, and named entities from a piece of text.

Before we start, make sure the SpaCy wrapper is installed.
```bash
pip install forte.spacy
```

Let's start by writing a simple processor that analyze POS tags to tokens using the good old NLTK library.
```python
import nltk
from forte.processors.base import PackProcessor
from forte.data.data_pack import DataPack
from ft.onto.base_ontology import Token

class NLTKPOSTagger(PackProcessor):
    r"""A wrapper of NLTK pos tagger."""

    def initialize(self, resources, configs):
        super().initialize(resources, configs)
        # download the NLTK average perceptron tagger
        nltk.download("averaged_perceptron_tagger")

    def _process(self, input_pack: DataPack):
        # get a list of token data entries from `input_pack`
        # using `DataPack.get()`` method
        token_texts = [token.text for token in input_pack.get(Token)]

        # use nltk pos tagging module to tag token texts
        taggings = nltk.pos_tag(token_texts)

        # assign nltk taggings to token attributes
        for token, tag in zip(input_pack.get(Token), taggings):
            token.pos = tag[1]
```
If we break it down, we will notice there are two main functions.
In the `initialize` function, we download and prepare the model. And then in the `_process`
function, we actually process the `DataPack` object, take the some tokens from it, and
use the NLTK tagger to create POS tags. The results are stored as the `pos` attribute of
the tokens.

Before we go into the details of the implementation, let's try it in
a full pipeline.

```python
from forte import Pipeline

from forte.data.readers import StringReader
from fortex.spacy import SpacyProcessor

pipeline: Pipeline = Pipeline[DataPack]()
pipeline.set_reader(StringReader())
pipeline.add(SpacyProcessor(), {"processors": ["sentence", "tokenize"]})
pipeline.add(NLTKPOSTagger())
```

Here we have successfully created a pipeline with a few components:
* a `StringReader` that reads data from a string.
* a `SpacyProcessor` that calls SpaCy to split the sentences and create tokenization
* and finally the brand new `NLTKPOSTagger` we just implemented,

Let's see it run in action!

```python
input_string = "Forte is a data-centric ML framework"
for pack in pipeline.initialize().process_dataset(input_string):
    for sentence in pack.get("ft.onto.base_ontology.Sentence"):
        print("The sentence is: ", sentence.text)
        print("The POS tags of the tokens are:")
        for token in pack.get(Token, sentence):
            print(f" {token.text}[{token.pos}]", end = " ")
        print()
```
It gives us output as follows:

```
Forte[NNP]  is[VBZ]  a[DT]  data[NN]  -[:]  centric[JJ]  ML[NNP]  framework[NN]  .[.]
```

We have successfully created a simple pipeline. In the nutshell, the `DataPack`s are
the standard packages "flowing" on the pipeline. They are created by the reader, and
then pass along the pipeline.

Each processor, such as our `NLTKPOSTagger`,
interfaces directly with `DataPack`s and do not need to worry about the
other part of the pipeline, making the engineering process more modular. In this example
pipeline, `SpacyProcessor` creates the `Sentence` and `Token`, and then we implemented
the `NLTKPOSTagger` to add Part-of-Speech tags to the tokens.

## And There's More
The data-centric abstraction of Forte opens the gate to many other opportunities.
Not only does Forte allow engineers to develop reusable components easily, it further provides a simple way to develop composable ML modules. For example, Forte allows us to:
* create composable ML solutions with reusable models and processing logic
* easily interface with a great collection of [3rd party toolkits](https://github.com/asyml/forte-wrappers) built by the community
* build plug-and-play [data augmentation tools](https://asyml-forte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/data_aug.html)
